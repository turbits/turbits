# Sup 🤘 🦆 

Nice to meet you!&nbsp;👋 &nbsp; I am a systems administrator in my day job. For fun, I toy around with a myriad of shit. My brain chemicals prevent me from being interested in one thing for more than a day or two at a time, but I do sort of a loop around all of the things that interest me - so you may see an odd variety of stuff here. Some of the stuff that interests me is:
- .NET
- Webdev / Typescript
- Game dev / Godot / (previously Unity, but [fuck Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlPOn0nAOeo&list=PLS9MbmO_ssyAyVCJrsdDfqvR8yLSpkf2T))
- 3D modeling
- 2D pixel art ([aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)) and [painting(procreate)](https://procreate.com/)
