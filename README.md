Nice to meet you!&nbsp;👋 &nbsp;

<br/>

I spend most of my development time hacking on my company's internal applications. We use a lot of tech, but it mostly boils down to Angular and React.

In my spare time I like hacking on things with React, C# (Unity), and sometimes [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/).
